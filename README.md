# Mapping Crisis

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the projects dependancies.

- clean install (faster)

```powershell
npm ci
```
- install additional packages

```powershell
npm i
```

First run the node server on http://localhost:5000 by 
typing this into the terminal

```powershell
node server.js
```

Then run the project on http://localhost:3000 by 
typing this into a seperate terminal

```powershell
npm run start
```
